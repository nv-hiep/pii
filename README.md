**1. Data and Analysis Notebooks for Physics-Informed Inference**\
This document includes the model designs, data and analysis notebooks associated with the study entitled "Mapping cold and warm neutral hydrogen in galaxies with neural networks". \
1.1) We use Neural Networks (e.g., Convolutional Neural Networks, Transformers) to design HI self-absorption (HISA) detectors. These HISA detectors identify HISA features in HI emission spectra, and extract their velocities.
1.2) We develop Physics-Informed Inference (PII) frameworks to infer HI gas temperatures from emission data alone.

Figure 1: Upper panel: Example of a detected HISA feature (red dotted line) in an HI emission spectrum observed towards the Riegel-Crutcher cloud (distance of ~125 pc or ~3.86 × 10<sup>15</sup> km from the Sun). Lower panel: Activation (or saliency) spectra generated by our HISA detector, raw activation spectrum in grey, smoothed activation spectrum in blue, and softmax activation in red. The velocity at the maximum activation value determines the central velocity of the detected HISA feature. \

Figure 2: HISA velocities identified by our conceptual HISA detector in the Riegel-Crutch cloud (at a distance of ~125 pc or ~3.86 × 10<sup>15</sup> km from the Sun). The colorbar represents the HISA velocity values. The spatial coherence of the HISA velocities is illustrated. The gray background shows the total emission at 5.5 km s<sup>-1</sup>. The direction towards the Milky Way center is at the center of the Figure, (longitude, latitude) = (0<sup>o</sup>, 0<sup>o</sup>). \

Figure 3: Preliminary results from a Physics-informed inference framework for inferring HI temperature $T_\mathrm{s}(v)$ and optical depth $\tau (v)$ profiles  from emission $T_\mathrm{b}(v)$. Left panels: Testing emission spectra (blue) as the inputs, reconstructed emission spectra (red). Middle panels: True temperature profiles (blue), inferred temperature profiles (red). Right panels: True optical depth profiles (blue), inferred optical depth profiles (red). Shaded regions represent uncertainty, visualised through 512 samples drawn from the posterior distribution. Observationally, due to the observational sensitivity limitations, temperature uncertainties for warm HI gas could reach 100\% when HI temperatures exceed 10<sup>3</sup> K. \
